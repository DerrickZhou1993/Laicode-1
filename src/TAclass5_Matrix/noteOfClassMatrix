		spiral print m*n matrix
		1    2    3
		4    5    6
		7    8    9        to    1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5
		
		basic idea: from [0][0] -> [1][1] -> ...
		and the size change of line should also be considered

Q2 Suppose every pixel of an image is stored in a n*n matrix, how to right rotate the image
   by 90 degrees
   
   1 2 3 
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   
   to 
   
   7 4 1
   8 5 2
   9 6 3
   
   sol1: iterative:
   		step1: rotate by pivot 159, the matrix becomes:	1 4 7
                                                        2 5 8
                                                        3 6 9
                                                        
       	step2: swap element between pivot 456 
                                    the matrix becomes:
                                                        7 4 1
                                                        8 5 2
                                                        9 6 3
		
		
Q3 for a m*n matrix, if an element is 0, then change all the elements which are on the same column and row
   with this element to 0;
   
   eg:
   	7 4 1
   	8 0 2
   	0 6 3
   	
   	to
   	
   	0 0 1
   	0 0 0
   	0 0 0 	
   	
Q4 find target in young tableau 
	1 6 9
	2 8 10
	5 9 12
	
	each row and element is sorted but not guarantee the last element of row i is smaller than first element of i + 1
	
	pay attention to top-right element
	
	we can treat this matrix as a tree and treat top-right element as root

                                        / \
                                       6   10
                                      / \    \
                                     1  8     12 
                                      \  \
                                      2   9
                                       \
                                        5        
                                               
                                     and this tree is similar to a BST



Q5 search kth smallest element from young tableau
1 6 9
2 8 10
5 9 12

	k = 4
	min-heap to store the element and its coordinate in matrix
	so we need to define a class for element to hold coordinate and value (class Cell)

Q6 find the length of max increasing path in a matrix
1 6 9
2 4 10
5 7 3

path: 
	
	basic idea: we do not know where the path begins, so we need to traverse every node of matrix
				and for each node in the matrix we need to check four directions of it
				so this is a dfs process and time complexity is O(4^n) n is total number of nodes of matrix
				
				consider prune (middle memory) in dfs
