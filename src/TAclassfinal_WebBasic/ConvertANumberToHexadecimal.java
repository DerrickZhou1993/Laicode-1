 	Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, 
 	twoâ€™s complement method is used.

	Note:
	
	All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
	The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
	The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
	You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
	Example 1:
	
	Input:
	26
	
	Output:
	"1a"
	Example 2:
	
	Input:
	-1
	
	Output:
	"ffffffff"

/*
 * basic idea:
 * 	initialize table of hex char
 * 	each time take a look at the last four digits of
    binary version of the input, and maps that to a hex char,
    then shift the input to the right by 4 bits, do it again
    until input becomes 0.
