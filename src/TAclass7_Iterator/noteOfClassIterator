Iterator
example:
	Iterator it = Collection.iterator();
	it.hasNext()
	it.next()

advantage of iterator
	need a way of abstracting the traverse operation on any kind of collections.
	The actual traversal algorithm should be decoupled
	Implementation detail should be specific to different kinds of collections
	The way we access to it should be general
	
	// basic implementation of Iterator Interface
	Interface Iterator {
		public boolean hasNext();
		public E next();
	}
	
Array Iterator
