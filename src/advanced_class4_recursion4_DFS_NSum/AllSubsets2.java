 * Q1.3 Given a set of characters represented by a String, return a list containing all subsets of the characters.

	Assumptions
	
	There could be duplicate characters in the original set.
	â€‹Examples
	
	Set = "abc", all the subsets are ["", "a", "ab", "abc", "ac", "b", "bc", "c"]
	Set = "abb", all the subsets are ["", "a", "ab", "abb", "b", "bb"]
	Set = "", all the subsets are [""]
	Set = null, all the subsets are []
