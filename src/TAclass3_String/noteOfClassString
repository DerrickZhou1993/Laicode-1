	step3: reverse rest characters ef abcd
	
Q3 how to find the character which only occur once in the given string
	eg. abaccdeff return b
		sol1: hash_map
		
		sol2: one-pass 
			which data structure can be used for traversing one time 
			when meet duplicate char, delete it
			and can also keep the order
			
			===> use map + doubly linked list
			
Q4 Minimum Window Substring. Given two strings S and T. Find the shortest substring S` in S to
   make S` contains all the chars occurred in T
   eg: T = aab
       S = aaacbc
       S` = aacb
