	1. Binary
		1.1 How to represent negative in binary
				two's complement: 
						0001            (+1)   取反加一
						1110 + 1 = 1111 (-1)
					the advantage is 0001(1) + 1111(-1) = 1 0000 = 0 (1 is sign bit so ignore it)
					so there is only addition in CPU arithmetic unit (addition rule also works for subtraction)
					
		1.2 How to represent non-integer
		    2.2(2 = 10 in binary) = 10.00110011001100110011...
			十进制小数转二进制小数方法：
			十进制小数→→→→→二进制小数 方法：“乘2取整”
			
			对十进制小数乘2得到的整数部分和小数部分,整数部分既是相应的二进制数码,再用2乘小数部分(之前乘后得到新的小数部分),又得到整数和小数部分.
			如此不断重复,直到小数部分为0或达到精度要求为止.第一次所得到为最高位,最后一次得到为最低位
			如:0.25的二进制
			0.25*2=0.5 取整是0
			0.5*2=1.0    取整是1
			即0.25的二进制为 0.01 ( 第一次所得到为最高位,最后一次得到为最低位)
			
			0.8125的二进制
			
			0.8125*2=1.625   取整是1
			
			0.625*2=1.25     取整是1
			
			0.25*2=0.5       取整是0
			
			0.5*2=1.0        取整是1
			
			即0.8125的二进制是0.1101（第一次所得到为最高位,最后一次得到为最低位）
			
			十进制小数→→→→→八进制小数 方法：“乘8取整” 
			
			0.71875）10 =（0.56）8
			
			 
			
			0.71875*8=5.75 取整5
			
			0.75*8=6.0      取整6
			即0.56
			
			十进制小数→→→→→十六进制小数方法：“乘16取整”例如： 
			
			(0.142578125)10=(0.248)16
			
			0.142578125*16=2.28125 取整2
			
			0.28125*16=4.5          取整4
			
			0.5*16=8.0              取整8
			
			即0.248
			
		
			For a binary number
			the format of this number is:
				SIGN |      EXPONENT      |    FRACTION
				(1bit)       (11bit)          52(bit)
				64 bits in total
				
		binary to decimal 
			fraction: 0 * 2^(-1) + 0 * 2^(-2) + 1 * 2^(-3) ....
			
		1.3 二进制        八进制        十进制         十六进制
		    1bit          3bit         special       4bit
		    
		   this design represents that a binary number can separate into n * 4bit to quickly decode to hexadecimal
		   
		   
		1.4 How to represent a character
			ASCII    ==> radically it is a map
			 7-bit can represent all the symbols in ASCII (0~127)
			 1 byte is enough (1 byte = 8 bits)
			 
		1.5 how to represent Chinese 
		unicode
			use a bit to store the length of info
		UTF-8	
		
		1st Byte             2nd Byte          3rd Byte        4th Byte          Number of Free Bits
		0xxxxxxx                                                                 7
		110xxxxx             10xxxxxx                                            5 + 6 = 11
		1110xxxx             10xxxxxx          10xxxxxx                          4 + 6 + 6 = 16
		11110xxx             10xxxxxx          10xxxxxx        10xxxxxx          3 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 21
		
		x represents real info, 1110 means this info is stored in 3 bytes
		'10' as initial is to make sure the info is in right format
		   
		example: decode byte[] to List<Integer> by UTF-8
		
		1.6 could 1G memory hold 1 million URL?
			Assume: average length of URL is 400 Byte (can ask to interviewer)
			400 b * 1 M = 400 Mb < 1GB 
			
	2. Computer Basic
		2.1 Computer Architecture
							  arithmetic unit 
						      L1
						      L2
						      Memory
						      Disk
						      Web/Cloud
						      
	    2.2 Google "The numbers every engineer should know"
	    
	    
	    2.3 Runtime = Computing Time(occur in cpu which is fast ) + Data Movement Time(pipeline or big data in distributed system which cost > computing time)
	    
	    2.4 Radically, the meaning of cache is to store the data which we need in the place where close to us.
	    	Cache Algorithm:
	    				LRU (least recently used)
	    				LFU (least frequently used)
	    
	    2.5 Virtual Memory
	    		The problem which the virtual memory tries to solve is lack of memory
	    		Program A is using some part of memory and other programs cannot use this part of memory    (single user and single task)
	    		
	    		
	    2.6 CPU Scheduling  
	    	similar to virtual memory
	    	one user multiple tasks:
	    			run program A ===> move it to disk
	    										run program B ===> move it to disk
	    												continue run program ===> move it to disk
	    												
	    			the process switch too fast that human cannot figure out the halt and it seems like 
	    			all the programs are running simultaneously.
